## Scientist Bio
My name is Kathleen Onorevole.  I usually tell people I'm a marine scientist.  If they're interested, I'll explain that I study [biogeochemistry] (http://piehlerlab.web.unc.edu/) or coastal restoration ecology.

## Three Things I've Been Doing at Work Recently
1. Collecting the last bits of ![field data] (http://newfs.s3.amazonaws.com/taxon-images-1000s1000/Poaceae/spartina-alterniflora-ha-mlovit-a.jpg) before the weather turns
2. Organizing the UNC Marine Science Grad Student Symposium
3. Compiling denitrification data from summer fieldwork

## Three Important Strategies for Organizing My Work
* Recording everything in my lab and field notebooks
* Keeping things organized in digital folders when saving work
* Using Mendeley to organize journal articles
