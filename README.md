# UNCMarSci-Kathleen
## Scientist Bio
My name is Kathleen Onorevole.  I usually tell people I'm a marine scientist.  If they're interested, I'll explain that I study [biogeochemistry] (http://piehlerlab.web.unc.edu/) or coastal restoration ecology.
## Three Things I've Been Doing at Work Recently
1. Collecting the last bits of field data before the weather turns
2. Organizing the UNC Marine Science Grad Student Symposium
3. Compiling denitrification data from summer fieldwork

## Three Important Strategies for Organizing My Work
* Recording everything in my lab and field notebooks
* Keeping things organized in digital folders when saving work
* Using Mendeley to organize journal articles
